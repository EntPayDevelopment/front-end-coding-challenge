Frontend developer challenge

** You may use any 3rd party packages
** Styling is not a focus of this challenge. However the layout / responsiveness is something we are interested in.

Challenge overview.
There is a mock api set up to facilitate this challenge.
The response simulates a data set of comedy movies and shows.

1. Using the response from the mock api, your objective is to generate a responsive Grid interface

2. Each movie or show should allow the user to add or remove from their watchlist. (This will only update the local state)And the state will be reflected to the user in the UI.
   (+) Add to watchlist
   (-) Remove from watchlist

Areas of interest.
State managment strategy.

1. Mapping the api response to local state.
   Data architecture.
1. Updates on local state should be done with Time and Space Complexity in mind.
   Component architecture.
